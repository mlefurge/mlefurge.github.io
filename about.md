My name is Matt LeFurge. I currently live in NYC, however, I grew up and have spent much of my life living in Connecticut. After graduating from Bucknell University with a B.S.B.A. in accounting, I joined forces with a public accounting firm and found myself pursuing my childhood dream of practicing corporate tax accounting. Okay, so maybe it wasn't my childhood dream but it's the reason I am where I am now.

Where am I now? I'm a "retired" certified public accountant and aspiring web developer. I'm someone who has taken the scenic route to finding something I'm really passionate about and something I can make a (new) career out of. I'm excited to have started this next phase in my life and for my time at Dev Bootcamp (don't forget to check out my blog if you want to hear more about my time at Dev Bootcamp!).
