   <h3>Blog Entry</h3>
    <p>
You don’t have to be a question expert or question connoisseur to determine a good question from a bad question.  I think one of the difficult parts about posting a good question is being able to balance the qualities that make a good question. You want to be detailed, but you don’t want to write an essay. You want to be specific, but you don’t want people to get lost in unimportant details. You want to help others understand and reproduce your problem but you don’t want to post 1000 screenshots or a copy of your entire code.  You have to consider these things, all while incorporating spelling, grammar and formatting.
    </p>
    <p>
Writing a good question that you will eventually post to a message board, blog or what have you is much different than asking a question to someone face to face.  You don’t have the benefit of talking to someone in real time to clarify you question or provide additional details. It makes it that much more important to consider all the characteristics that I mentioned above in your original post.
