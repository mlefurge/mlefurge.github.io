   <h3>Blog Entry</h3>
    <p>
Gregorc’s Mind Styles model is a way to identify how your mind operates and can help identify your preferred learning style. I scored relatively similar on three of the four types of thinking; concrete sequential, abstract sequential and abstract random. After reading the characteristics that are associated with each of the learning styles, I found that, depending on the situation, I could agree with a majority of what they were saying. While this might make it more difficult for myself to identify one specific learning style, I do think that it could be to my benefit as I go through DBC.  There appear to be a whole variety of ways that we are going to be learning throughout the program.  Since I scored so similarly on three mind styles, I might have an easier time adapting to the different styles.

I think the biggest struggle for me so far has to do with the fact that I have been out of school for a while so I am not in a “learning mode”.  Waking up every day to read texts books and solve problems is much different than going into an office and performing the job that I’ve become so familiar with over the years.  I’m slowly getting use to the transition but what has made it much easier is that I’m really excited about what I’m learning and I look forward to getting started with my work everyday.

In order to continue to expand the way I learn and think, I have to remember to stay open minded. When someone has a different way of doing something, I should embrace that. I should be eager to try it out and welcome it. It’s only been three weeks but every week I have tried to become really involved with the google community and to participate in google hangouts or conversations above and beyond the minimum requirement. I think that the more I expose myself to other people and their thought processes, the more I will learn.
