   <h3>Blog Entry</h3>
    <p>
      When I heard the term "version control" being used in one of the earlier exercises, I was reminded of a place that I was hoping to leave behind and forget forever. It wasn't too long ago that I was neck deep in all of the version control programs and processes of my previous employeer. As freightening as it was to hear this term being used (due to the flashbacks I was having about my old job), it was a little reassuring to hear a concept that I have become so familar with.
    </p>

      Version control is a way to work on a project while being able to keep track of changes made along the way. It also allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project without disturbing or overwriting the work of others.The way version control works is fairly simple. A master copy of the project you are working on is kept untouched. Whenever someone wants to work on the project they create a new version, or branch, that they can work on locally. When they are finished making changes to their branch, the changes can be merged back into the master copy. If multiple people created branches off the same master copy, these can all be merged into the master copy, keeping (or discarding) all appropriate changes. If, along the way, someone made an error that was merged into the master copy, all you would need to do is to load the previous version of the project. No need to redo all your work.
    </p>

      Unfortunately, when I would type up essays in college, I was unaware of version control. So, when I would do something stupid, such as accidently hit the hotkeys for select all, delete and save at the same time, I was left sitting at my computer in a state of rage and panic. Luckily, as developers, to avoid similar issues and to implement version control we can use git and GitHub.

      Git is a version control system that helps manage the history of a project you are working on. It allows you to save different versions of your work as you progress while keeping track of the changes you make along the way. Git software is installed locally on your computer and performs version control for the local user(s). GitHub is a web-page that acts as a hub for Git repositories. It allows multiple people to work on a project and collaborate while still maintaining version control.
