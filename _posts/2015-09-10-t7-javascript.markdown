I didn’t think I’d be admitting this, or at least not admitting to it this so soon. I miss Ruby. There, I said it and I’m not ashamed of it. One of the things that I miss most about Ruby is Ruby Documentation. While my love and appreciation for the Ruby Docs wasn’t instantaneous, the more I work in JavaScript, the more I’m reminded of how helpful they became.  While often difficult to read for a beginner, Ruby Docs were a repository of all things Ruby. There were even different versions of Ruby Docs for the different versions of Ruby Software (and even different versions in different languages).

Maybe it’s because I’ve only been fumbling around with JavaScript for a week, but I can’t seem to find an equalivant resource. It’s not that there aren’t ANY resources out there for JavaScript, it’s just that none of them seem to be put together in as elaborate a manner as the Ruby Docs.  My Google searches generally result in links to Mozilla’s Developer Network (MDN) JavaScript Documents as well as w3school’s JavasScript website.  These are both good resources and I’m sure my appreciation for them will grow in the coming months, but at the end of the day, I sure do miss Ruby and Ruby Dos.
