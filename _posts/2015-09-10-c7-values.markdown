The two values that I selected from the “Exploring your values” section are, close relationships and friendships. I find that I am happiest, proudest and most satisfied when I am with my closest family and friends or when I am sharing experiences with them. These people play a significant role in my life and the relationships I have with them is very important.

I think relationships and friendships are very important when dealing with difficult situations. If I were in a situation where stereotype threat was a threat, I do believe that those values would be able to mediate it.
